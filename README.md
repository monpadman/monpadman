- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" in the context of computer programming has an interesting origin? In 1947, computer pioneer Grace Hopper found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She taped the moth into the logbook and wrote, "First actual case of bug being found." Since then, the term "debugging" became synonymous with fixing computer glitches and errors.
